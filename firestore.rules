/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Poot Quest.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-related data (users, characters, decks, narrative contexts, and run chronicles).
 * Data is organized under user-specific paths (e.g., /users/{userId}/...), ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own data.
 * Global data such as Cards are publicly readable but not writable.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User account information, accessible only to the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/characters/{characterId}: Character data, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/characters/{characterId}/decks/{deckId}: Decks of cards, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/characters/{characterId}/narrativeContexts/{narrativeContextId}: AI-related narrative content
 * - /users/{userId}/runChronicles/{runChronicleId}: Game run history, accessible only to the user.
 * - /cards/{cardId}: Publicly readable card data, writable by admins only (not implemented in this version).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly denied as there is no top-level `list` rule on `/users`.
 * - Default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Documents under `/users/{userId}` implicitly have the `userId` denormalized into their path, allowing for simple `isOwner(userId)` checks.
