/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Boot Quest.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for most data, ensuring users can only access their own information.
 * Global card data is publicly readable but admin-writeable (currently not implemented).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Access is restricted to the user themselves.
 * - /users/{userId}/characters/{characterId}: Stores character data. Access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/characters/{characterId}/decks/{deckId}: Stores card decks. Access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/characters/{characterId}/narrativeContexts/{narrativeContextId}: Stores AI narrative context. Access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/runChronicles/{runChronicleId}: Stores game run history. Access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - /cards/{cardId}: Stores global card definitions. Publicly readable, but write access should be admin-only (not yet implemented).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly denied.
 * - Write operations are NEVER allowed with `if true;`.
 * - Data validation focuses on ownership and relational integrity, with relaxed schema enforcement for rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * Path-based ownership (e.g., /users/{userId}/characters/{characterId}) is used to avoid the need for `get()` calls to verify ownership.
